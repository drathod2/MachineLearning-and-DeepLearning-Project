# Predicting Used Car Prices with Machine Learning Algorithms

Project Description:

This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars using various machine-learning algorithms. With a dataset of 20,063 used car records and 11 features, we trained and compared linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, polynomial regression, random forest, and KNN models on different platforms such as a local computer, Google Colab, and AWS SageMaker. We aimed to develop a model that can accurately estimate car prices based on factors like trim, mileage, year, and color. Additionally, we explored the Random Forest Model with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve prediction accuracy. By evaluating each model's performance and training times, including the Random Forest Model with PCA, we provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses, allowing users to make informed decisions when selecting the most appropriate model for their specific requirements.

Conclusion:

In this project, we aimed to predict the prices of used cars based on various features using different machine-learning algorithms. After evaluating the performance and training times on different platforms, we found that the Random Forest Model with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy, achieving an R-Squared value of 0.98 and a Mean Absolute Error of 1.5. Although this model required more computational resources and longer training times on certain platforms, it provided the most accurate results. Alternatively, the Polynomial Regression Model and Random Forest Model offered a balance between accuracy and training time, making them suitable options for scenarios with limited computational resources. The findings of this project provide valuable insights for selecting the most appropriate model based on the desired trade-off between prediction accuracy and training time, serving as a foundation for further exploration and optimization.
